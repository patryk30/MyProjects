# My Projects
In this repository I include the most interesting projects I've done during my studies. 

## 1. Dababases project
  The main aim of the project was to design relational database for the streaming platform which offers access to thousands of movies. Main points of the project:
  * Tables creation by SQL code.
  * Introducing indexes in order to improve SQL query performance.
  * Writing several SQl SELECT queries to prepare some reports.
  * Preparation of Stored Procedure due to which records with movie viewings older than definded time period are moved to the archive table.

Detailed project description and report in Polish are in seperate files in 'Databases' folder.
